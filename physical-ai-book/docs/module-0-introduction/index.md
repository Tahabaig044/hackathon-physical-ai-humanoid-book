# Module 0: Introduction to Embodied Intelligence

Welcome to the foundational module on Embodied Intelligence and Physical AI. This module introduces the core concepts that underpin all physical AI systems and humanoid robotics.

## Overview

This module covers the fundamental principles of embodied intelligence - the idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment. You'll explore how this differs from traditional digital AI and why it's crucial for humanoid robotics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Define embodied cognition and its importance in robotics
- Explain how physical interaction shapes robot intelligence
- Contrast digital AI with physical AI approaches
- Understand why humanoid robots specifically require embodied intelligence
- Identify real-world applications of embodied AI systems
