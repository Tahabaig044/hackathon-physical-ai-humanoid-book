# Basic Concepts

This document covers the fundamental concepts of ROS 2.

## Nodes

A node is an executable that uses ROS 2 to communicate with other nodes. Nodes can publish or subscribe to messages, provide or use services, and have parameters.

## Packages

Packages are the software organization unit in ROS 2. Each package can contain libraries, executables, configuration files, and other resources.

## Workspaces

A workspace is a folder where you modify and build ROS 2 packages.
