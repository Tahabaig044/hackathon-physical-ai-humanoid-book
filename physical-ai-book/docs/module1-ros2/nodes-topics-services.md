# Nodes, Topics, and Services

This document explains the communication mechanisms in ROS 2.

## Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental unit of execution in ROS 2. They are processes that perform computation.

## Topics and Publishers/Subscribers

Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. Publishers send messages to a topic, and subscribers receive messages from a topic.

## Services

Services provide a request/response communication pattern between nodes.
