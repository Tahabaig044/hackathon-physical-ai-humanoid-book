# Research Plan for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Outstanding Research Questions:

1.  **Docusaurus/Frontend Testing Framework**: Identify best practices and suitable testing frameworks for Docusaurus-based applications and general frontend components (e.g., unit, integration, E2E).
    *   **Decision**: Jest with React Testing Library for unit/integration; Cypress/Playwright for E2E.
    *   **Rationale**: Jest and React Testing Library are standard for React components, aligning with Docusaurus's stack. Cypress/Playwright provide robust E2E testing capabilities for full application flows.
    *   **Alternatives Considered**: Other E2E frameworks like Puppeteer or Nightwatch.js, but Cypress and Playwright offer broader community support and features.

2.  **Performance Goals**: Define realistic performance goals for the Docusaurus site and the FastAPI RAG backend (e.g., page load times, API response latency, concurrent user capacity).
    *   **Decision**: Jest with React Testing Library for unit/integration; Cypress/Playwright for E2E.
    *   **Rationale**: Jest and React Testing Library are standard for React components, aligning with Docusaurus's stack. Cypress/Playwright provide robust E2E testing capabilities for full application flows.
    *   **Alternatives Considered**: Other E2E frameworks like Puppeteer or Nightwatch.js, but Cypress and Playwright offer broader community support and features.

3.  **Constraints**: Identify any critical technical, operational, or business constraints that need to be considered during implementation (e.g., budget, infrastructure limitations, security policies).
    *   **Decision**: Jest with React Testing Library for unit/integration; Cypress/Playwright for E2E.
    *   **Rationale**: Jest and React Testing Library are standard for React components, aligning with Docusaurus's stack. Cypress/Playwright provide robust E2E testing capabilities for full application flows.
    *   **Alternatives Considered**: Other E2E frameworks like Puppeteer or Nightwatch.js, but Cypress and Playwright offer broader community support and features.
